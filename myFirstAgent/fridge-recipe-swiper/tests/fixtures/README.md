# Test Fixtures

Place test images in this directory:

- `fridge.jpg` - A photo of fridge with ingredients (for happy path tests)
- `test-image.png` - Small test image (auto-generated)

Note: For E2E tests with mocked API, the actual image content doesn't matter.
For integration tests with real Gemini API, use actual fridge photos.
